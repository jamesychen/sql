Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:

                    SELECT COUNT(*)
                    FROM table
	
  
  
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

                     SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(key))
                     FROM table


  i. Business = 10000 (id)
  ii. Hours = 1562 (business_id)
  iii. Category =  2643 (business_id)
  iv. Attribute = 1115 (business_id)
  v. Review = 8090 (business_id)
  vi. Checkin = 493 (business_id)
  vii. Photo = 6493 (business_id)
  viii. Tip = 3970 (business_id)
  ix. User = 10000 (id)
  x. Friend = 11 (userid)
  xi. Elite_years = 2780 (userid)

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: "no"
	
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	
	SELECT *
  FROM user
  WHERE id IS NULL OR 
        name IS NULL OR

4. For each table and column listed below, display the smallest (minimum), largest (maximum), and average (mean) value for the following fields:

    
     SELECT MIN(column), Max(column), AVG(column)
     FROM table


	i. Table: Review, Column: Stars	
  
		min: 1		max: 5		avg:  3.7082 

	
	ii. Table: Business, Column: Stars

  (Output limit exceeded, 25 of 10000 total rows shown)


	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
	
  
  Yes, there seems to be some weak positive correlation between them. 
  As fans decrease, review counts decrease as well.


	
9. Are there more reviews with the word "love" or with the word "hate" in them?

	Answer: Yes (1780 vs 232)

	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
  

  To get love counts:
 
 
	SELECT COUNT(*) 
  FROM review
  WHERE text LIKE '%love%'


  To get hate counts:
  
  
  SELECT COUNT(*) 
  FROM review
  WHERE text LIKE '%hate%'


	
10. Find the top 10 users with the most fans:

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	
  
  SELECT id, name, fans
  FROM user
  ORDER BY 3 DESC
  LIMIT 3

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
    City: Las Vegas
    Category: Restaurants
  
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

   Yes, they do have a different distribution. However, Wingstop has the same total hours of operation with Big Wong Restaurant.
   
ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
         
   Yes. However, Wingstop has similar total to Jacques Cafe.
   
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

     Yes and No. From the table we can see the higher the review counts the higher the rating based on this three groups.
     However, the duration of the operaing hours or the time cannot indicate which will lead to a higher star rating.
     
     Notice: output returned 3 groups in total, the sample size are too small.


    SQL code used for analysis:
      

		    SELECT name, review_count, hours, stars, 
                CASE 
                WHEN stars Between 2 AND 3 THEN '2-3 stars'
                WHEN stars Between 4 AND 5 THEN '4-5 stars'
                END star_rating
        FROM business b
        JOIN category c ON b.id = c.business_id
        JOIN hours h ON b.id = h.business_id
        WHERE city = "Las Vegas" AND category = "Restaurants"

2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
  i. Difference 1:
     
     mean_star (open): 3.67,              mean_star (close): 3.52
      

  ii. Difference 2:
      
      mean_review_counts (open): 31.75 ,     mean_review_counts (closed): 23.19
      
         
         
      SQL code used for analysis:


      SELECT AVG(stars) mean_star, 
             AVG(review_count) mean_review_counts, 
             is_open
      FROM business b 
      GROUP BY 3

      +---------------+--------------------+---------+

      +---------------+--------------------+---------+

  
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
         
   I'm trying to see the types of food against rating and total reviews.
 
   
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
                           
    I pick out four categories of food I'm particular interested in including Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Indian, and I will compare them against
    the average star ratings and total count of reviews. I chose to include the number of restaurants as a reference for the total review counts and the average stars.
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
     
    +----------+-----------------------+---------------+---------------+
    | category | number_of_restaurants | review_counts |    AVG(stars) |
    +----------+-----------------------+---------------+---------------+
    | Korean   |                     7 |            56 |           4.5 |
    | Chinese  |                    13 |          5502 | 3.76923076923 |
    | Indian   |                     6 |           192 |           3.5 |
    | Japanese |                    20 |           457 |         3.475 |
    +----------+-----------------------+---------------+---------------+
         
iv. Provide the SQL code you used to create your final dataset:


    
    SELECT category, COUNT(b.name) number_of_restaurants, SUM(review_count)review_counts, AVG(stars)
    FROM business b
    JOIN category c ON b.id = c.business_id
    JOIN hours h ON b.id = h.business_id
    WHERE c.category IN ('Chinese','Japanese','Korean','Indian') 
    GROUP BY 1
    ORDER BY 4 DESC
